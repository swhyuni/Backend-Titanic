# **Titanic Survival Prediction using ANN (Sequential and Functional API) with Backend Flask Deployment**

## **Description:**
Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project! This comprehensive project combines the power of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) through two distinct approaches - Sequential and Functional API models - to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset. The trained ANN models are deployed using Flask, with the backend deployed on Koyeb and the frontend on Hugging Face.

## **Key Features:**
1. Dual ANN Models: Compare the performance of the Sequential and Functional API-based ANN models in predicting passenger survival outcomes.

2. Backend and Frontend Deployment: The backend of the project, implemented using Flask, is deployed on Koyeb, while the frontend is deployed on Hugging Face, providing an integrated deployment experience.

## **Technology Stack:**
1. Python: The project is crafted using the Python programming language.

2. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): Both Sequential and Functional API models are used for predicting passenger survival outcomes.

3. Flask: The project utilizes Flask to build the backend and facilitate communication with the frontend.

4. Koyeb: The backend is deployed on the Koyeb platform, ensuring accessibility and seamless integration with the frontend.

5. Hugging Face Deployment: The frontend is deployed through Hugging Face, enhancing accessibility and user engagement.
